    "Linear regression is not suited because any encoding implies an ordering of the categories and selecting a distance among them, which in most cases is not sensible. In the binary case, one could transform the response variable into 0s and 1s and build a linear regression model: this would lead to an OK model, even if some predictions could be larger than 1, and so it would be difficult to interpret the result of it as a probability of classifying the input as belonging to class 1."
